The first page of the website is a login form. It does not contain any authorization. Its just a frontend of it. It would work even if no data is input in the fields.
The second page is an Inventory Dashboard showing all the available machines and items in the lab in numbers and the right side shows cards to book stuff. **Note that the second page is completely a frontend. There is no backend linked to it so it won't show any change in the items of the carts and 'my account' tab.**
